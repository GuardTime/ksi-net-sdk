Version 3.1

* IMPROVEMENT: Added some convenience methods for API users:
	- Ksi class Sign methods taking Stream or byte[] as a parameter
	- KsiProvider class CreateDataHasher method without parameters
	- PublicationsFile class GetNearestPublicationRecord method taking DateTime as a parameter
* IMPROVEMENT: Made certificates loading thread-safe.
* BUGFIX: Modified http request headres that are not supported by aggregation servers any more (removed 'Expect' header and changed 'Connection' header to 'Close').
* REMARK: If you will be signing serveral documents per second then consider setting max allowed http connections in your App.config file. Bear in mind that one signing request takes around 1 second.
