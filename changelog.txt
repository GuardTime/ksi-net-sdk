* BUGFIX: Added aggregation hash chain index match rule (KSINETAPI-65)
* IMPROVEMENT: Removed SHA-224 support. Added strict legacy id tag check on signature parsing. (KSINETAPI-62)
* IMPROVEMENT: Changed signature identity separator to <space>::<space>
* IMPROVEMENT: Changed the order of the identity fields. Now the order of the identity fields are reversed, e.g. higher-aggregator :: lower-aggregator :: gateway :: user
* BUGFIX: Aggregation hash chain right links equality check fix (KSINETAPI-63)

Version 3.1

2016-03-21 3.1.0

* IMPROVEMENT: Added some convenience methods for API users (KSINETAPI-58):
	- Ksi class Sign methods taking Stream or byte[] as a parameter
	- KsiProvider class CreateDataHasher method without parameters
	- PublicationsFile class GetNearestPublicationRecord method taking DateTime as a parameter
* IMPROVEMENT: Made certificates loading thread-safe. (KSINETAPI-57)
* BUGFIX: Modified http request headres that are not supported by aggregation servers any more (removed 'Expect' header and changed 'Connection' header to 'Close'). (KSINETAPI-56)
* REMARK: If you will be signing serveral documents per second then consider setting max allowed http connections in your App.config file. Bear in mind that one signing request takes around 1 second.
